## Redirecting to a specific url in `React-Router` Link

If you are on a url with link `login/` and you redirect to `register/` then what react-router will do is that it will push you to `login/register` url but this isn't what you want to achieve.

In order to redirect to `register` url you have to pass url like `/register` now react-router will redirect you to `register/` url.

## Never use onSubmit() in `button` tag
